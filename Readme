Some notes in anticipation of v. 0.98:

   this is now a F90 code
   no more common blocks
   new driver glow_drv uses input from TIE-GCM or TIME-GCM or empirical models
     ultimately this will include WACCM-X as well
   namelist input from file glow.inp
   netCDF output to a file specified in namelist input
   can still run with empirical models:
     default empirical neutral model updated to MSIS-2K
     NOEM empirical nitric oxide model, based on SNOE data, used for empirical runs
     IRI-90 still used for empirical ionosphere

New features as of v. 0.97:
   Relativistic correction to electron impact cross sections included
   Maxwellian or monoenergetic fluxes generated by MAXT
   Possible to use any solar grid by changing only input files
   Photoabsorption and photoionization cross sections supplied in files
   SSFLUX completely re-written:
      Model parameters supplied in files
      Default is ~1 nm grid (5 nm in FUV)
      Hinteregger model still there (ISCALE=0)
      EUVAC also available (ISCALE=1)
      User grid and input supported by changing input file and LMAX (ISCALE=2)
   Common block CGLOW is unchanged
      Should facilitate upgrade path for existing programs
      But there are now several obsolete artifacts

Issues addressed in v. 0.97:
   Fixed two problems with Auger electron production
   Fixed some small bugs in O(1S) calculation
   Adjusted N(2D)+O rate coefficient to Fell et al. value (6.9e-13)
   Adjusted C III on N2 cross section to fix O2 ionization rate problem
   Removed various artifacts, including EAURI
   Removed unnecessary N(2D) initial guess (now just set to zero)
   Now use standard energy and altitude grid in both day and aurora examples

Known problems:
   X-rays shortward of 18 A need to be re-examined and updated.
   Magnetic field (GEOMAG, FIELDM) is out of date, really need to update to 
      IGRF, but at the resolutions typical here should be OK for now.
   Temporary Y2K fix to SUNCOR.  Should be fine for 1950-2050, but really
      need to change from yyddd to yyyyddd date format, which will enable
      range of validity to extend from 1900-2100.  (This only affects SZA.)
   O(1S) needs to be re-evaluated (still).
   O(1S) from O2 dissociation (BSO2) is currently hardwired - only works with
      LMAX=123 (although changes shortward of 800 A are OK).
   IRI should be updated.
